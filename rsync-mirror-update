# rsync-mirror-update: rsync-mirror with update.
#
# Syntax:
#
#     rsync-mirror-update [syntax is the same as rsync]
#
# Example:
#
#     rsync-mirror-update ~/foo/ ~/bar/
#
# This script is based on `rsync-mirror` which sets these options:
#
#   -a, --archive           archive mode; same as -rlptgoD (no -H)
#   -H, --hard-links        preserve hard links
#   -O, --omit-dir-times    omit directories when preserving times
#   -x, --one-file-system   don't cross filesystem boundaries
#   -z, --compress          compress file data during the transfer
#   -i, --itemize-changes   output a change-summary for all updates
#
# This script also sets this option:
#
#   -u, --update            skip files that are newer on the receiver
#
# This script deliberately does not set these options:
#
#   -v, --verbose           increase verbosity
#   --partial               keep partially transferred files
#   --progress              show progress during transfer
#   --copy-links            transform symlink into referent file/dir
#   --safe-links            ignore symlinks that point outside the tree
#
# Reasons:
#
#   * We like --hard-links even though this is an expensive calculation.
#   * We only use --omit-dir-times because dir times fail on some systems.
#   * We do not use --partial because temp dirs fail on some systems.
#   * We want symlinks as-is, thus no --safe-links, --copy-links, etc.
